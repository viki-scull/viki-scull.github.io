  <p>A procedurally generated map for the deck-building Roguelike, Knights in Tight Spaces (developed by Ground Shatter, published by Raw Fury).</p>
<p>Because each run is uniquely generated, we needed a map to be uniquely generated. Here is a brief overview of how that was achieved in Unity, using shaders and VFX Graph.</p>
<p>If you want to generate your own landmasses, I suggest watching Sebastian Lague&rsquo;s Procedural Landmass Generation series on YouTube, because that helped me A LOT</p>

<div class="oneThird">
  <p>I used a generated cloud island texture, with step nodes to create the shape of the land.</p>
<p>The interactive map is a whole lot of cells, hidden underneath the visual map and within the code I could use this texture to dictate which cells were land and water</p>

<div class="oneThird">
  <p>The trees and villages are made with VFX graph. I found random locations on the map and drew little clusters of dots in RGB channels of a texture.</p>
<p>This was used as a mask within VFX graph to say what sprites should spawn where.</p>

  I sampled the texture and moved it slightly in four directions, getting the difference between them all for the outline.

  The dotted lines are LineRenderers that follow a group of cells under the map, scaled up. They have some random jiggle on them to make them interesting and of course they use the same cloud texture as a mask to hide them under the water
