Petaverse is an unreleased tamogotchi style mobile game, in which players could adopt their own custom cats and play a variety of games with them.

I worked as the technical artist on this project, and my main tasks were to develop the fur on the cats, and make them nice and fluffy, and to make a video of the cats hatching, which the players would see upon purchase of their new companion.
