{{< block class="twoThirds portfolio" >}}
A procedurally generated map for the deck-building Roguelike, Knights in Tight Spaces (developed by Ground Shatter, published by Raw Fury).

I worked as a technical artist on this project, working with the artists to develop the visual style of the game through shaders and post processing, while also creating magic VFX for the spells cast in this fantasy game, and the map, which changes with each playthrough.

There is still more to add to this page.
