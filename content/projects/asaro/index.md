We were comissioned to make a series of pirate themed mini games for an adventure holiday company.

With another programmer, I helped design several little games that used a shooting mechanic inlcuding a semaphore puzzle, steady wire game and another where a water pistol cleaned off a dirty map. We had a special phone holder created with a prop pistol, so that the players were physically holding a little gun when shooting in game.

As well as programming and game design for this project, I created small visual effects and shaders that worked within the interactions.
