 I joined Fictioneers in early 2020 and worked as a Unity Dev for the final year of production of The Big Fix Up. As part of the Unity team I helped to build the augmented mini games that make up the main interactive part of the app.

As well as programming AR interactions I also created animations, shaders and other effects to help bring this app to life.

It was absolutely incredible to work with such a beloved IP, as I, like so many others, grew up watching Wallace and Gromit.
