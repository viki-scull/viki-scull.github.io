# Hi I'm Viki

I'm a Unity Developer and Technical Artist. I have experience making AR applications and PC games. And I love making visual effects and shaders, as well as using procedural generation to create art and tools for games.

I'm from the UK, and currently based in Tokyo. I am open to part-time or short term contract work
